'''
In this example, we first define the input shape as a 32x32 RGB image. 
We then define the blurring function, which applies a simple averaging filter to the input image to simulate blurring. 
We apply this function to the input image to generate a blurred image tensor. 
We then define the low-resolution branch, which downsamples the blurred image by a factor of 2 using average pooling and applies two convolutional layers. 
We also define the high-resolution branch, which applies one convolutional layer to the input image. 
We then upsample the low-resolution branch and concatenate it with the high-resolution branch. 
We apply a series of transformer blocks to the concatenated tensor, and then apply a final convolutional layer to generate the output image.

Note that this is just a simple example and you may need to adjust the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve better performance. 
Additionally, you will need to preprocess the Tiny Image 200 dataset and prepare it for training.
